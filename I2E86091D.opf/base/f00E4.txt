From the interdependent self-nature Comes discrimination arising from conditions;The perfection of the fruit comes from A
lways being apart from the former nature.

Therefore in relation to the interdependent, It is neither different nor is it not different,Just like the nature of impe
rmanence, etc., And when one is not perceived, the other is.

On the basis of the three kinds of self-nature Is established the threefold absence of self-nature;Thus the Buddha spoke 
with the hidden intent That all dharmas are without nature.

The first is the naturelessness of characteristics, The next is the naturelessness of self-existence;The last is the deta
chment from the first, When the natures of self and dharmas are grasped.

This is the ultimate truth of all dharmas, And it is also the same as True Suchness.Because its nature is eternally so, I
t is the true nature of Consciousness Only.

So long as one has not given rise to the consciousness Which seeks to abide in the nature of Consciousness Only,Then rega
rding the two types of grasping dispositions, He is still not yet able to subdue and extinguish them.

Setting up and establishing even something small And saying this is the nature of Consciousness Only,Because there is sti
ll something which is grasped, It is not truly abiding in Consciousness Only.

When one regards that which is conditioned With the wisdom of total non-appropriation,Then at that time one abides in Con
sciousness Only, Apart from the duality of grasping at appearances.

Without grasping and not conceptualizingâ€” This is the wisdom of the supramundane realmWhich abandons the coarseness of du
ality And naturally attains transformation of the basis.

This is itself the untainted realm, Inconceivable, good, and eternal,Peaceful and blissful, the body of liberation, And w
hat the great Muni called the Dharma.
